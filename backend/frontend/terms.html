                <p class="terms-intro">Thank you for booking Elise Care Home Entertainment. These terms and conditions
                    apply to all bookings and form part of the agreement between Elise Care Home Entertainment ('Elise')

                <h2>1. Booking Confirmation</h2>
                <p>A booking is confirmed once the Client has agreed to these terms of booking, either in writing

                <p>Elise will arrive at least 15 minutes before the scheduled performance time to allow for setup.</p>

                <h2>3. Equipment</h2>
                <p>Elise provides all necessary equipment for the performance, including PA system, microphone, and
                    backing tracks where applicable. The Client is required to provide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access to a suitable performance space</li>
                    <li>Access to at least one electrical socket for the speaker system</li>
                    <li>A safe and clear area for equipment setup</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Fees and Payment</h2>
                <p>The performance fee will be agreed at the time of booking and confirmed in writing. Payment is due on
                    the day of the performance or within 7 days of invoice, unless otherwise agreed in advance.</p>
                <p>Payment may be made by bank transfer, cheque, or cash. Bank details will be provided on the invoice.

                <p>The following cancellation policy applies to all bookings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rebooking within 3 months:</strong> If the Client cancels but rebooks within 3 months of
                        the original booking date, no cancellation fee will be charged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cancellation with 4 weeks or more notice:</strong> A cancellation fee of 50% of the
                        agreed fee will apply.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cancellation with less than 4 weeks notice:</strong> The full agreed fee (100%) will be
                        payable.</li>

                <p>All cancellations must be communicated in writing (including email or text message).</p>

                <h2>7. Cancellation by Elise</h2>
                <p>Elise reserves the right to cancel a booking in the event of illness, emergency, or circumstances
                    beyond her control. In such cases, the Client will be offered an alternative date at no additional
                    cost, or a full refund of any fees already paid. Elise will make every effort to provide as much
                    notice as possible and, where feasible, arrange a replacement performer.</p>

                <h2>8. Insurance</h2>

                <h2>9. Health and Safety</h2>

                    responsible for ensuring the performance area is safe and suitable for the entertainment.</p>

                <h2>10. Special Requirements</h2>
                <p>Any special requirements, such as specific song requests, themed performances, or adjustments for
                    residents with particular needs, should be communicated to Elise in advance of the performance date.
                    Elise will make every effort to accommodate such requests.</p>

                <h2>11. Amendments to Booking</h2>
                <p>Any changes to the booking (date, time, or performance requirements) must be agreed in writing by
                    both parties. Changes are subject to availability.</p>
